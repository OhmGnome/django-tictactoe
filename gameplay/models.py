# The persisted objects that generate migrations
# Migration helps keep local dev and environment databases in sync (like java hibernate)
# by generating SQLs
# from the terminal: python manage.py has migration commands:
# migrate - is responsible for applying and unapplying migrations.
# makemigrations - is responsible for creating new migrations based on the changes you have made to your models.
# sqlmigrate - displays the SQL statements for a migration.
# showmigrations - lists a projectâ€™s migrations and their status.
